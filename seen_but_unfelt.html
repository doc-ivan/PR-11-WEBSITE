        Tristan was in the darkest and deepest point of his life. Like a candle, he tried his best to make his life meaningful and bright, even as his energy slowly melted away. A single tear began to fall. Tristan, a Grade 11 student from Lemery, struggled to connect with others. Socializing felt like a burden, and his own shyness became a prison. No matter how much he wanted to reach out, something always held him back—fear, doubt, or maybe the thought that no one would truly understand. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Tristan was at the lowest point of his life. As he walked down the street, he saw a car speeding toward him. A single thought consumed his mind—ending it all. Just as he was about to step forward, a girl named Zia grabbed him, pulling him back. Her voice trembled as she asked, 'Are you okay'.Zia asked Tristan if he was okay, but he just closed his eyes, trying to comfort himself. He whispered to himself over and over, 'I'm okay... I'm okay... I'm okay.' But Zia asked again, her voice filled with concern. As Tristan slowly calmed down, he hesitantly opened his eyes—only to hear Zia’s voice growing louder, repeatedly asking, 'Are you okay?!' And then, as he truly saw her—her worried eyes, her outstretched hand—something felt different. Something warm. Something bright. A feeling he thought he had long forgotten.And then, as he truly saw her—her worried eyes, her outstretched hand—something felt different. Something warm. Something bright. A feeling he thought he had long forgotten. Tristan was speechless for a moment, overwhelmed by the unfamiliar sensation. Then, finally, he answered, 'I'm okay.' Zia, still looking at him with concern, asked, 'Why did you do that?' Tristan didn’t say anything about what was running through his mind. Instead, Zia let out a small sigh and said, 'You know what? Let's go for a walk.' Tristan hesitated before responding, 'Where are we going?' With a gentle smile, Zia replied, 'Somewhere that will make you feel better.'

        They walked to the seashore near the highway, the crashing waves filling the silence between them. As they strolled along the shore, their footsteps fading into the sand, Tristan finally asked, "Why did you save me?"
        <br>
        <br>
        Zia paused, looking at him for a moment before softly replying, "Because... I see myself in you."
        <br>
        <br>
        Tristan hesitated before asking, "You see yourself in me...? What do you mean?"
        <br>
        <br>
        Zia let out a small sigh. "I can see it in your eyes—you’re carrying something heavy. You don’t have to tell me everything, but maybe... maybe you can share it with me. I might be able to help."
        <br>
        <br>
        Tristan stayed quiet, his gaze fixed on the sunset, trying to hold back his tears.
        <br>
        <br>
        Sensing his hesitation, Zia took a deep breath and began sharing her own struggles—the pain she carried, the battles she fought. As she spoke, Tristan slowly realized how similar their stories were. And as she finished, she smiled faintly and said,
        <br>
        <br>
        "No matter how much we struggle, no matter how unfair life seems... we have to keep going. Because I believe, one day, the world will finally be on our side.
        <br>
        <br>
        After a brief silence, Zia turned to him again. "Tristan... what’s really going on? What brought you here?"
        <br>
        <br>
        Tristan clenched his fists, his breathing uneven. He tried to hold back his tears, but the weight in his chest felt unbearable. Taking a shaky breath, he finally spoke.
