        We are students from Arellano University (JAS), and as part of our school project for 
        this academic year, we have been given the opportunity to create a website. Our 
        project, VISIONPATH, is a platform dedicated to crafting and sharing original stories 
        designed to captivate and engage readers.
        <br>
        <br> 
        At VISIONPATH, we believe in the power of storytelling to entertain, inspire, and 
        connect people from all walks of life. Our goal is to provide a space where creativity 
        thrives, allowing both aspiring and experienced writers to share their unique narratives 
        with a broader audience. In addition to publishing our own original content, we 
        encourage individuals to submit their personal stories, giving them the opportunity to 
        have their work featured on our website.
        <br>
        <br> 
        We created VISIONPATH with the vision of building a community where readers and 
        writers can come together to celebrate the art of storytelling. Whether it’s a fictional tale, 
        a personal experience, or an inspiring journey, we believe that every story has the 
        potential to make an impact. Through this platform, we hope to spark imagination, 
        evoke emotions, and ultimately leave a lasting impression on our readers.
        <br>
        <br>
        By providing a space for creativity and self-expression, we aim to foster a love for 
        iterature and storytelling, making VISIONPATH not just a website but a meaningful and 
        engaging experience for all.

          The right-side arrow symbolizes the choices you make or the direction you're heading, while the right-side lens represents vision.                  
          Overall, the logo design reflects the purpose and features of the website.
